You have 100 records of data provided from the input. Each record consists of three fields:
name age identifier

where name is a string of characters of length not more than 100, and age and idenfier are two numbers
between 0 and 1000000.

Write the program writing to the output the sorted list of records. You must
implement one of the sorting algorithms: SelectionSort or BubbleSort.
Sorting should be done in the following way: 
first sort by age in the non-decreasing order, and in the case of the same age sort by identifier in the nondecreasing order. 
You may assume that each identifier is unique.
Example Input (4 records in the example, instead of 100):
Giorgi 25 1001
Frank 35 1005
Olaf 25 1000
Pio 35 1002

Example Output:
Olaf 25 1000
Giorgi 25 1001
Pio 35 1002
Frank 35 1005
